# Python-Terminal-Games

My recreations of popular text-based online games in Python (without external modules, as far as possible) for the terminal.

## External Libraries (if any):
- **Wordle**: Requires `nltk.corpus`  
- **Monkeytype**: Requires `nltk.corpus`
- **Piano Tiles**: None required  

### Notes:
- The goal of this project is to update my programming portfolio with practical applications, while enhancing my Python skillset.
